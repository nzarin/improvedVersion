## General info
This project addresses the issue of efficient and secure peer discovery across multiple DHTs. The simulator is built in order
to allow industry and academia test how various protocols will perform in for example the internet of blockchains scenario.
Currently, the main DHT protocol used in this simulator is Kademlia.

## Simulator architecture

## Set-up
An example example.cfg configuration file can be found in the  main directory. Kademlia configuration values can be found in
the class "KademliaCommonConfig.java".

To compile the sources, invoke:

```
  make
```

To compile the API documentation, invoke:

```
  make doc
```

To run the code, invoke:

```
  make run
```

To run all the previous command in this order, invoke:

```
  make all
```
